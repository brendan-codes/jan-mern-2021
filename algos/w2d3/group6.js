// #1 Missing Value

// You are given an array with the length of n that contains in no order integers from 0 to n.
// The length of the array is n and the largest number is no bigger than n.

// Quickly determine and return the missing value.

// The short version: If I give you an array of 0-9 and it's missing a number, how do you find it?

// given [3, 0, 1]
// return 2

// given [5, 2, 7, 8, 4, 9, 3, 0, 1]
// return 6

function findMissingValue(arr) {}


// #2 Min of Sorted-Rotated

// You are given an an array of integers with a length of up to 255 thousand.
// This array has first been sorted, then rotated by an unknown amount.

// Find and return the minimum value.

// Ninja Goal: Do this faster than 0(n) ie: find your answer without visiting every single element
// (think binary search)

// Given [17, 18, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
// return 3

function minOfSorted(arr, low = 0, high = arr.length - 1) {}
